- Graceful error handling

## Installation

Place all files in a folder (see structure above).

### 2. Add Your OpenAI API Key
Go to the extensionâ€™s Options page and enter your key (format: `sk-...`).

### 3. Load in Chrome
- Open `chrome://extensions/`
- Enable **Developer mode**
- Click **Load unpacked**
- Select your extension folder

### 4. Production Packaging (.crx)
1. **Minify all JS/CSS files** (see instructions above)

## Notes
- You must have an OpenAI API key for this to work.
- Transcript fetching uses youtubetranscript.com (subject to availability).

## Troubleshooting
- If the popup says "Transcript not available" or "Failed to summarize," check the video has captions and your API key is valid.
